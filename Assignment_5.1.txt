1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)

Find P(Z > 2.64)

> pnorm(2.64, lower.tail = FALSE)	# OR	pnorm(2.64, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
# P(Z > 2.64) is 0.004145301

Find P(|Z| > 1.39)

> 2 * pnorm(-1.39) 	# OR	1 - (pnorm(1.39, mean = 0, sd=1) - pnorm(-1.39, mean = 0, sd=1)) 
# P(|Z| > 1.39) is 0.1645289



2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the officer's claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%? Use an alpha = 0.01 significance level.

Solution:

Our null hypothesis in this problem is H0 : p = 0.4 and the alternative hypothesis is H1 : p < 0.4. 

We reject the null hypothesis if phat is too small, that is, if ((phat - 0.4) /SQRT (0.4(1 - 0.4)/n) < -zalpha,  where alpha = 0.01 and -z0.01 is 

> -qnorm(0.99)

[1] -2.326348

There is no mathematical difference between the errors, however. The bottom line is that we choose one type of error to control with an iron fist, and we try to minimize the probability of making the other type. That being said, null hypotheses are often by design to correspond to the "simpler" model, so it is often easier to analyze (and thereby control) the probabilities associated with Type I Errors.

Our only remaining task is to find the value of the test statistic and see where it falls relative to the critical value. We can find the number of people admitted and not admitted to the UCB graduate school with the following.


> A <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
> head(A)

     Admit Gender Dept Freq
1 Admitted   Male    A  512
2 Rejected   Male    A  313
3 Admitted Female    A   89
4 Rejected Female    A   19
5 Admitted   Male    B  353
6 Rejected   Male    B  207

> xtabs(Freq ~ Admit, data = A)

Admit
Admitted Rejected 
    1755     2771

# Now we calculate the value of the test statistic.

> phat <- 1755/(1755 + 2771)
> (phat - 0.4)/sqrt(0.4 * 0.6/(1755 + 2771))

# -1.680919

Our test statistic is not less than -2.32, so it does not fall into the critical region. 

Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true proportion of students admitted to graduate school is less than 40% and say that the observed data are consistent with the officer's claim at the alpha = 0.01 significance level.
